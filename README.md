# ETG_PythonAI_Internship_InventoryManagementSystem
Inventory-Management-System Creator: Simran Shyam Patil  Problem: One of the major issues for small-scale shopkeepers is keeping track of their inventory and sales. Most often they spend a lot of time and effort to manage their inventory as well as keep a record of their sales.  Introduction: I have created an Inventory Management System to manage the goods for small-scale shops using the power of python and JSON. This will save a lot of time and effort for the shopkeepers and facilitate them in the tedious task of managing inventory and sales.  Functionalities and working: This project is actually divided into 2 files:  1.Adding_Elements_into_Inventory: In this part, We create a records.json file which contains all the Inventories with details like product id(barcode), name, quantity, price,isAvailable, Expiry date. Here we can add new goods to the inventory and the records will be stored in the records.json file.  2. Product Purchase: In this part, a)We enter the transaction or purchase details like product id, no. of items purchased, name of customer, mobile number of the customer. b)If the purchased items are available in inventory, then Bill is generated c)The details of the transactions are then stored in sales.json file with attributes like total transactions, transaction id, date, time, product name, the total amount of purchase, customer name and customer mobile number.  Tools used: python - 3.7 JSON Thank You!
