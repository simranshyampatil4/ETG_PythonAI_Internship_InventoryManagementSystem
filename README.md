Problem: One of the major issues for small-scale shopkeepers is keeping track of their inventory and sales. Most often they spend a lot of time and effort to manage their inventory as well as keep a record of their sales.  

Introduction: I have created an Inventory Management System to manage the goods for small-scale shops using the power of python and JSON. This will save a lot of time and effort for the shopkeepers and facilitate them in the tedious task of managing inventory and sales.
